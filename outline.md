# Shift Management Implementation Plan

## 1. Database Schema Setup
- Create Shift model in Prisma
- Create necessary relations with User model
- Define shift types/categories
- Add relevant fields (start time, end time, status, etc.)

## 2. Backend API Routes
- POST /api/shifts - Create new shifts
- GET /api/shifts - Fetch shifts (with filtering)
- PUT /api/shifts/{id} - Update shifts
- DELETE /api/shifts/{id} - Delete shifts
- GET /api/users - Fetch available staff members

## 3. Frontend Components
- Calendar view component
- Shift creation modal/form
- Shift details view
- Staff selection dropdown
- Time/date picker components

## 4. Core Features
- View shifts in calendar format
- Create new shifts
- Assign staff to shifts
- Edit existing shifts
- Delete shifts
- Filter shifts by date range
- Filter shifts by staff member

## 5. UI/UX Considerations
- Color coding for different shift types
- Clear indication of assigned/unassigned shifts
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Success notifications

1. Set up database schema
2. Create basic API endpoints
3. Build calendar view component

5. Add staff assignment
6. Add edit/delete functionality

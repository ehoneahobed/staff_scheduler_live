### **1. Initial Setup**

1. **Create Your Project**:
   - First, create a new Next.js project. Since you’ll be using TypeScript, you’ll want to initialize the project with TypeScript support from the start.

2. **Folder Structure**:
   - Next.js uses a file-based routing system, meaning each file in the `app` directory becomes a route. Organize your folders to keep things clear (e.g., `components`, `pages`, `lib`, `models`).

3. **Set Up Git Version Control**:
   - Initialize a Git repository to keep track of your code changes. Platforms like GitHub can host your repository, and you can revert to any previous version of your code if needed.

### **2. Configure Tailwind CSS for Styling**

1. **Install Tailwind CSS**:
   - Add Tailwind CSS to your Next.js project. You’ll configure a `tailwind.config.js` file, where you can set up custom themes and colors.

2. **Use Shadcn UI Components**:
   - Shadcn UI provides pre-designed components, which work well with Tailwind. Install Shadcn UI components and import them wherever needed to save time on designing and styling elements manually.

3. **Customizing UI**:
   - Define global styles in your `globals.css` and customize Tailwind’s configuration in `tailwind.config.js`. Make sure the UI is consistent with your brand (colors, spacing, typography).

### **3. Set Up Database with Prisma and PostgreSQL**

1. **Install Prisma and PostgreSQL**:
   - Install Prisma in your Next.js project, which will help you interact with your PostgreSQL database.
   - For PostgreSQL, use a cloud-hosted database (like Supabase or NeonDB) if you want a managed solution, or set it up locally.

2. **Initialize Prisma**:
   - Initialize Prisma to create a `schema.prisma` file. This file defines your database tables (called models) and their relationships.

3. **Define Models**:
   - Create models for your main entities, such as `User`, `Shift`, `SwapRequest`, and `LeaveRequest`.
   - Specify fields (e.g., `id`, `name`, `startDate`, `endDate`) and relationships (e.g., one-to-many relationships between `User` and `Shift`).

4. **Migrate Your Database**:
   - Use Prisma’s migration tool to apply the changes you defined in `schema.prisma` to the PostgreSQL database, creating tables that match your models.

### **4. Build Core Features Step-by-Step**

1. **Shift Management**:
   - Create pages or components for the manager’s scheduling dashboard. Use Shadcn UI components to build a calendar view where managers can assign shifts to users.
   - Use Prisma queries to pull shift data from the database and display it in the UI. For assigning shifts, set up forms that allow managers to select staff and shift types.

2. **Shift Swapping**:
   - Design a component for staff to request swaps. Add a button that lets users select a colleague or broadcast a request.
   - In your database, track swap requests and their statuses (pending, approved, declined).
   - Build a simple interface for managers to view and approve/decline swap requests.

3. **Leave Management**:
   - Set up a leave request form for staff. When a request is submitted, store it in the database.
   - Create an approval section for managers to review requests. Once approved or declined, update the request’s status in the database.

4. **Attendance Tracking**:
   - Add a clock-in/clock-out function to allow staff to mark their attendance. Use a form or button component to capture timestamps.
   - Store attendance records in the database, and allow managers to review this data on a summary page.

### **5. Implement Routing and APIs**

1. **File-Based Routing**:
   - Next.js routes are determined by the file structure in the `app` folder. Each file corresponds to a URL, so create separate files for each major page (e.g., `/schedule`, `/shifts`, `/swap-requests`).

2. **API Routes**:
   - Use Next.js API routes to handle data fetching and updates. For example:
      - `/api/shifts` to fetch shift data or add new shifts.
      - `/api/swap-requests` for handling shift swap requests.
   - Inside each API route, use Prisma queries to interact with the database. API routes let you separate the backend logic from the frontend display.

### **6. Authentication and Authorization**

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Implement authentication to secure user data. You could use a library like NextAuth for managing user sessions.
   - Set up roles (e.g., manager and staff) to control access. Managers will need access to the scheduling and approval features, while staff will have access to their own schedules and swap requests.

2. **Role-Based Access**:
   - Add conditional rendering on the UI based on roles. For example, show the scheduling dashboard only if the logged-in user is a manager.

### **7. Notifications and Alerts**

1. **Real-Time Notifications**:
   - Use a notification library to show alerts within the app for actions like shift assignment or swap request approval. For real-time updates, consider using web sockets or polling.

2. **Schedule Reminders**:
   - Implement scheduled notifications for upcoming shifts, swap deadlines, or clock-in reminders. While Next.js doesn’t have built-in cron jobs, you could use a serverless function or third-party service like Firebase Cloud Messaging for scheduled push notifications.

### **8. Testing and Debugging**

1. **Testing Individual Components**:
   - As you build each feature, check that they work as expected by testing individual pages and components.
   - For database interactions, make sure Prisma queries return the correct data before displaying it.

2. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Test actions like overlapping shifts, late swap requests, and denied leave requests to make sure the platform handles them smoothly.

### **9. Deployment**

1. **Choose a Hosting Platform**:
   - Platforms like Vercel (the creators of Next.js) work well for deploying Next.js apps and are beginner-friendly.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Store sensitive data (e.g., database credentials, API keys) in environment variables, which are securely managed by the platform.

3. **Database Migration on Deployment**:
   - Before launching, run Prisma migrations on your production database to ensure it’s up-to-date with the latest model definitions.

### **10. Maintenance and Future Features**

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Periodically update dependencies (e.g., Next.js, Prisma) to benefit from security patches and new features.

2. **User Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from initial users to identify areas for improvement. Add more features incrementally, like automated shift rotation or an advanced attendance system.
